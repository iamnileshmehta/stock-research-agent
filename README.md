# stock-research-agent

An end-to-end rule-based stock research system that combines technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and LLM-generated insights to produce actionable stock market reports.

This project is designed with clean architecture, modular design, and explainable logic, focusing on engineering discipline rather than black-box AI.

🚀 Features
🔹 Market Data Collection

Fetches real-time and historical stock data using Yahoo Finance (yfinance)

Retrieves both price data and fundamental metrics

🔹 Technical Analysis (Rule-Based)

Indicators used:

Simple Moving Average (SMA 20, SMA 50)

Relative Strength Index (RSI)

MACD

Clear rule-based signals:

Bullish / Bearish / Neutral

Score-based evaluation for trend strength

🔹 Fundamental Analysis (Rule-Based)

Valuation metrics:

PE Ratio, Price to Book

Profitability:

ROE, Net Profit Margin

Liquidity:

Current Ratio, Quick Ratio

Debt Management:

Debt to Equity

Cash Flow & Dividend metrics

Intrinsic value estimation

Scoring system to derive:

Strong Bullish / Bullish / Neutral / Bearish / Strong Bearish

🔹 AI-Generated Insights (LLM)

Uses Gemini (free tier) as the LLM

LLM does not perform analysis

LLM only:

Interprets already-computed indicators

Generates human-readable summaries

Produces actionable insights

⚠️ Analysis logic is fully deterministic and explainable.
AI is used only for narration, not decision-making.
